# 🖥️ DATA STRUCTURES

<p style = "text-align: justify">In this repository, there are some codes about data structures for examples lists, stacks and between others.
This repository was created with the aim of helping me with my studies on data structs in the Algoritms and Data Structure I
(AEDI) at USP.</p>

<p>The study on data structure was carried out using the C programming language. Furthermore, the data structures that were implemented were:</p>

- Lists
- Stacks
- Queue
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- AVL Tree

### ⌨️ Execution
<p> To run the program, simply download the code to your computer, go to the folder where the "main.c" file is located and type in the terminal:</p>

> gcc -o main main.c <br>
./main
